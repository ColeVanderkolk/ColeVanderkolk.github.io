    For my final project i plan to refine my compass mobile website
    i plan to turn it into more of an actual interactive compass
    i would like the compass to have the ability to do a few things:
    live change when the phone is rotated, have the ability to set the waypoint (due north) to any 
    place on earth that you want by inputting a set of coordinates, have the website change in some way as 
    you approach your desired destination (im thinking color, if within 1000 feet change to blue or something)


    some examples i will be looking into duplicating aspects of:
    https://onlinecompass.app/
    https://www.onlinecompass.org/app/
    https://www.gps-coordinates.net/

    I will plan on trying to hand draw or 3D design my compass within blender, i would like it to be a simple webpage but 
    i would like to focus more on ui, as comparitive websites online are not as user friendly and pretty as they could be 
    also having something that works well on mobile above all else will be my goal as 
    the majority of users that would be using any sort of compass would want it to be handheld as if it was a real one 
    it will have the compass in the center along with a slow changing backround color and a simple unique looking compass design 

    P.S. sorry this is so hastily put together and not using figma im currently taking 247 and trying my best to get through it 
    but its been hard and not left me with much time for other classes.
