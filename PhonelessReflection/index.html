    <p class="main-content">
        With a generation of people stuck to their phones, these days it seems like the idea of leaving your phone
        behind would be as important as leaving your keys, wallet, or any other vital things you may need. its only
        once you put your phone down for a moment that you realize for thousands of years people havent been able to
        call eachother,
        track eachother, look up directions, etc. that was one of the most eye opening things for me. I have never been
        that glueed to
        my phone, thankfully I have set boundaries that make sure that I am not just on my screen all day scrolling away
        my life though im sure I would if I tried.
        I think that being away from the short form content that im used to was probably the most dramatic difference in
        my life, even
        though I dont do much I underestimated how boring the bus is without music, how long bathroom breaks actually
        are without my games, And
        how it doesnt matter how long until the next bus is going to be here... im gonna have to wait anyways. I didnt
        tell anyone that I was putting my phone away for a day besides
        my girlfriend who I live with, mainly becuase we use our phones to enter our building, but part of me felt kind
        of relieved. I imagine that back before the day of email and text message
        life was a lot slower paced and calming, you wouldnt get emails letting you know how youre behind in 100
        different ways, and how everyone else is doing,
        you could literally only worry about your own life and maybe a select few of the people around you because
        unless you actually heard it from their mouth you would never
        know. for me also the biggest disruptor was not always knowing the time, always checking how many hours minutes
        seconds until whatever I was doing was done
        and I had to go do something else, how many precious minutes could I spend doing the things I want to do before
        I went to do the things I had to do. it felt like
        some pressure was lifted to be perfectly on point for everything and instead I could go back to the realm of
        approximately. I didnt have to worry about competing with others
        I was just in my own space with nothing but the people directly around me. showing that no matter how many
        followers, text groups, or podcasts I had, the only people that would be
        there if anything were to happen were literally those sitting right next to me. It also made it painstakingly
        aware that unlike back in the day when you were most likely to make friends with those
        you shared a commute with, or worked with, or were around consistently, instead our lives are formed by the
        people that we are not around in those moments, that most of
        my social group isnt regularily around me and that even though ive seen the same people on my bus route, at my
        bus stop at the same time for weeks, I'll likely never know their name
        becuase their just the bus people... and I'm listening to my music.
